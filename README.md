 Image Classification


It import the tensorflow and keras libraries, as well as the matplotlib.pyplot library. These libraries will be used to load the MNIST dataset, build a neural network, train the neural network, and plot the results.
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

It loads the MNIST dataset into the Python interpreter. The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits.

mnist = keras.datasets.mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()


It normalizes the pixel values in the MNIST dataset to the range [0, 1]. This is done to improve the performance of the neural network.

# Normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1]
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0


It reshapes the images in the MNIST dataset to match the input shape of the neural network. The neural network expects the input images to be 28x28 pixel grayscale images.

# Reshape the images to match the input shape of the model
train_images = train_images.reshape(train_images.shape[0], 784)
test_images = test_images.reshape(test_images.shape[0], 784)

Plot the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object in the source code.


The architecture of the neural network is defined. The neural network has three layers: a 64-neuron hidden layer, another 64-neuron hidden layer, and a 10-neuron output layer. The activation function for the hidden layers is relu, and the activation function for the output layer is softmax.

# Define the model architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

To compile the neural network. The optimizer='adam' argument specifies that the Adam optimizer will be used, the loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy' argument specifies that the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function will be used, and the metrics=['accuracy'] argument specifies that the accuracy metric will be used.

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

It is used to train the model

history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

It plot the loss and accuracy for both training and validation data. This is done to see how the model performs
# Plot the loss and accuracy for both training and validation data
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()


plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()



Plot one of the images in the test data, and then do inferencing to check what is the prediction of the model on that single image.

selects one image from the test data and makes a prediction on that image.
The image = test_images[0] line selects the first image from the test data.
The plt.imshow(image.reshape(28, 28)) line plots the image.
The prediction = model.predict(image.reshape(1, 784)) line makes a prediction on the image. The model.predict() method takes an image as input and returns a vector of probabilities. The element with the highest probability is the predicted class.
The print("Model Prediction:", prediction.argmax()) line prints the predicted class. The prediction.argmax() method returns the index of the element with the highest probability.
In this case, the predicted class is 7,


# Select one image from the test data
image = test_images[0]


# Plot the image
plt.imshow(image.reshape(28, 28))
plt.show()


# Do inference on the image
prediction = model.predict(image.reshape(1, 784))


# Print the prediction
print("Model Prediction:", prediction.argmax())


 
We had used 2 hidden layers and Relu activation. Try to change the number of hidden layer and the activation to tanh or sigmoid and see what happens. 
creates a new neural network with a different architecture than the previous neural network. The new neural network has three layers: a 128-neuron hidden layer, a 64-neuron hidden layer, and a 10-neuron output layer. The activation function for the hidden layers is tanh, and the activation function for the output layer is softmax.
The model_new.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) line compiles the new neural network. The optimizer='adam' argument specifies that the Adam optimizer will be used, the loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy' argument specifies that the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function will be used, and the metrics=['accuracy'] argument specifies that the accuracy metric will be used.
The model_new.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels)) line trains the new neural network. The epochs=10 argument specifies that the model will be trained for 10 epochs. The validation_data=(test_images, test_labels) argument specifies that the model will be evaluated on the test data after each epoch.
The results of training the new neural network may be different from the results of training the previous neural network.


model_new = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='tanh', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='tanh'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


model_new.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_new = model_new.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))


â†’ we observe that there is little decrease in loss and increase in accuracy.

Run the same code without scaling the images and check the performance?

It defines a neural network model with two hidden layers, trains it without scaling the input images, and evaluates its performance. The model uses the ReLU activation function for the hidden layers, softmax activation for the output layer, and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The training is performed for 10 epochs with the Adam optimizer. 

model_no_scaling = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


model_no_scaling.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_no_scaling = model_no_scaling.fit(train_images * 255.0, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images * 255.0, test_labels))




Note: The images are multiplied by 255.0 before training to rescale them from the original range of 0-1 to the range of 0-255.
